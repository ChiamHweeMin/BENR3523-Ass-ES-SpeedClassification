# Ass-ES-SpeedClassification
***ASS-SpeedFan-DataLogging*** is used to import the raw accelerometer data into NanoEdge AI studio to 
automatically find the best bundle of signal processing, machine learning model, and hyperparametrization given the input signals provided.

The resulting NanoEgde AI Library will be the best fit for the use case selected, and it will be untrained.

The library, *libneai.a, NanoEdgeAI.h, knowledge.h* are placed in the path **acc_lib** of ***ASS-SpeedFan-NanoEdgeLibClassification*** to classify input signals with the trained knowledge.
